### Kindle-Specific Tips
- **First connection** always takes longer - be patient!
- **Tap refresh** in browser if connection seems stuck
- **Use landscape mode** on Kindle for wider documents
- **Portrait mode** is perfect for reading documents and PDFs
- **Bookmark the page** for quick access later

### Optimizing Connection Quality
1. **Start with these settings:**
   - Quality: 80% (for crisp text)
   - Resolution: 1.0x (full detail)
   - FPS: 2-3 (perfect for e-ink refresh rate)
   - Rotation: 90¬∞ (portrait) for documents

2. **If connection is slow:**
   - Reduce quality to 60%
   - Try resolution scale of 0.8x
   - Lower FPS to 1-2

## üîß Optimizing for E-ink Displays

### Perfect Settings for Kindle
```
Quality: 70-90% (crisp text without overloading)
Resolution Scale: 0.8-1.0x (full detail for reading)
FPS: 1-3 (matches e-ink refresh capabilities)
Rotation: 90¬∞ for documents, 0¬∞ for wide content
