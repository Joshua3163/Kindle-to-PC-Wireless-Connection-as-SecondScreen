## üöÄ Getting Started

Screen Mirror Server allows you to wirelessly display your PC screen on any device with a web browser. No apps needed on your phone, tablet, or other devices!

### What You Need

2. You connect to this server from any device on your network
3. Your screen is streamed in real-time through your web browser

## üíæ Installation Methods

### Method 1: Portable Executable (Easiest)
Perfect for quick use or trying out the app:

1. **Download** `ScreenMirrorServer.exe` from the releases
2. **Double-click** to run - no installation needed!
3. **Allow** Windows Firewall access when prompted

### Method 2: Full Installation (Recommended)
Best for regular use with desktop shortcuts and Start Menu integration:
